ðŸ“Œ Customer Churn Prediction â€“ From Data to Business Strategy

Losing customers is costly â€” not only in revenue but also in acquisition expenses.
I recently completed a project on Customer Churn Prediction using the Telco dataset (7,043 records, 21 features).

ðŸ”Ž Key Findings from Data Analysis

Senior citizens and new subscribers are more prone to churn.

High monthly charges correlate with higher churn rates.

Lack of online security increases churn likelihood.

ðŸ›  Approach

Preprocessed & engineered features (e.g., average charges per tenure).

Balanced dataset with SMOTE.

Compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and tuned XGBoost.

ðŸ“ˆ Results

Accuracy: ~80% | ROC-AUC: 0.84

Top drivers: Contract type, Online Security, Tech Support, Monthly Charges, Tenure

ðŸ’¡ Business Insights
âœ… Offer discounts/bundles to high-charge customers.
âœ… Loyalty programs for short-tenure customers.
âœ… Promote online security features to reduce churn.
